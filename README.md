This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel. The easiest way to deploy is:

1. Push your code to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
2. Import your repository on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and use the configuration in `vercel.json`
4. Your site will be deployed and live!

### Migration from Netlify

This project has been migrated from Netlify to Vercel due to Netlify's 300 monthly credits not renewing. The project is now configured for Vercel deployment with static export.

**Hosting Cost Note:** R500 has been allocated for hosting costs from the account.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
